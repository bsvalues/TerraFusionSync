## Deployment Configurations

### Production County Deployment
```bash
# Required Duo Security Credentials
DUO_ADMIN_IKEY=your_duo_admin_integration_key
DUO_ADMIN_SKEY=your_duo_admin_secret_key
DUO_ADMIN_API_HOST=api-xxxxxxxx.duosecurity.com
DUO_AUTH_IKEY=your_duo_auth_integration_key
DUO_AUTH_SKEY=your_duo_auth_secret_key
DUO_AUTH_API_HOST=api-xxxxxxxx.duosecurity.com
DUO_APPLICATION_KEY=40_character_random_string

# Security Settings
DUO_MFA_TIMEOUT=300
DUO_SESSION_TIMEOUT=900
DUO_BYPASS_LOCALHOST=false
```

### Development Environment
```bash
# Development Mode (No Duo Credentials Required)
DUO_BYPASS_LOCALHOST=true
DUO_MFA_TIMEOUT=300
DUO_SESSION_TIMEOUT=900

# Mock authentication accepts:
# - Test code: 123456
# - Any 6-digit numeric code
# - Push notification simulation
```

## API Endpoints Added

### MFA Authentication Endpoints
- `GET /mfa/login` - MFA login page
- `POST /mfa/login` - Process login credentials
- `POST /mfa/verify` - Verify MFA challenge
- `POST /mfa/push` - Handle push notifications
- `GET /mfa/status` - Check authentication status
- `POST /mfa/logout` - Secure logout with session cleanup

### Integration Points
- **Admin Dashboard:** Protected with `@require_mfa` decorator
- **API Access:** MFA validation for sensitive operations
- **Vendor Access:** Enhanced security for external integrations
- **RBAC System:** Integrated with user management

## County Integration Requirements

### Prerequisites for County Deployment
1. **Duo Security Account:** Active county Duo Security subscription
2. **Application Registration:** Register TerraFusion in Duo Admin Panel
3. **Integration Keys:** Generate Admin API and Auth API keys
4. **Network Configuration:** Ensure firewall allows Duo API access

### Duo Admin Panel Configuration
1. **Create Application:**
   - Applications > Protect an Application
   - Select "Auth API" for authentication
   - Select "Admin API" for user management

2. **Generate Keys:**
   - Note Integration Key (public)
   - Note Secret Key (private - keep secure)
   - Note API Hostname

3. **User Enrollment:**
   - Ensure county users are enrolled in Duo
   - Configure authentication methods per county policy
   - Set up bypass codes for emergency access

### Security Compliance Alignment

#### Benton County Security Policy Compliance
- **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Required for all administrative access

- **Audit Logging:** Complete tracking of authentication events
- **Device Trust:** Support for county-managed device policies

#### Federal and State Compliance
- **NIST Security Framework:** Aligned with federal cybersecurity standards
- **State Data Protection:** Meets Washington State security requirements
- **CJIS Compliance Ready:** Supports criminal justice information standards

## Testing Procedures

### Development Testing
1. **Mock Authentication:** Use test code 123456 for verification
2. **Session Testing:** Verify timeout and logout functionality
3. **UI Testing:** Confirm responsive design and accessibility
4. **Error Handling:** Test invalid credentials and timeout scenarios

### Production Validation
1. **Duo Integration:** Verify actual Duo push notifications
2. **User Enrollment:** Test with enrolled county users
