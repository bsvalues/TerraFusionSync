3. API Gateway - terrafusion_gateway (Flask)This service acts as the public-facing API, handling authentication, RBAC, and proxying requests to the terrafusion_sync service.(Code for terrafusion_gateway files like requirements.txt, services/sync_core_client.py, routes/valuation_routes.py, routes/reporting_routes.py, middleware/auth.py, and main.py are included in the code block with ID terrafusion_gateway_code above.)4. Shared Configuration & OrchestrationPlaceholders and conceptual stubs for shared environment variables, local development setup, and pipeline orchestration.(Code for .env.sample, docker-compose.yml, and orchestration/dags/terrafusion_pacs_bulk_load_dag.py are included in the code block with ID terrafusion_config_orchestration above.)5. Next Steps for Replit AI AgentImplement Database Models:Define SQLAlchemy models (e.g., in terrafusion_sync/core_models.py or terrafusion_sync/models/) for PropertyOperational, and other relevant entities for the operational database.Ensure these models are created in the PostgreSQL database (e.g., using Alembic for migrations, or a simple Base.metadata.create_all(engine) for initial development, though Alembic is better for production).Flesh out Plugin Services:In terrafusion_sync/plugins/valuation.py (and reporting.py, etc.), implement the actual business logic within the service classes/functions. This includes:Querying the operational database using the AsyncSession.Performing calculations or data transformations.Interacting with other plugins or core sync services if needed.Develop Core Sync Pipelines:Implement the logic in terrafusion_sync/pipelines/ for:bulk_load_pipeline.py: Connecting to legacy CAMA systems (using connectors), applying mappings (from mappings.yaml), and writing to the TerraFusion operational DB.cdc_pipeline.py: Implementing Change Data Capture.etl_to_specialized_dbs.py: Moving/transforming data from the operational DB to GIS, Analytics, and Archive stores.Implement Authentication & RBAC in Gateway:Develop the terrafusion_gateway/middleware/auth.py with robust token validation (e.g., JWT) and role/permission checking.Create terrafusion_gateway/routes/auth_routes.py for login, logout, token refresh endpoints.Integrate rbac_required_actual (or a more robust version) into all protected Gateway routes.Build Out Connectors:Implement the pacs_sql_server_connector.py and other connectors in terrafusion_sync/connectors/ to handle actual data I/O.Refine Orchestration:Detail the Airflow DAGs or Kubernetes CronJobs in orchestration/ to reliably schedule and monitor data pipelines. Implement the actual triggering logic within the DAGs.Dockerfiles:Create Dockerfile for terrafusion_gateway and terrafusion_sync to containerize these services.Testing:Write unit tests for plugins, connectors, and transforms.Write integration tests for the Gateway-to-Sync communication and for data pipelines.This handoff package provides a structured starting point. The Replit AI Agent can now focus on implementing the TODO sections and building out the detailed logic for each component.
