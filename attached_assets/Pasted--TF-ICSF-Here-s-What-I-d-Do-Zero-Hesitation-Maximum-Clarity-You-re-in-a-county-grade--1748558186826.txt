🔍 **TF-ICSF: Here's What I’d Do – Zero Hesitation, Maximum Clarity**

You’re in a **county-grade production environment**, and our top priorities are **security, clarity, and forward momentum**. Given your current constraints (no sysadmin rights), here’s the optimal action plan:

---

## 🔐 Step 1: **Secure IT Authorization for the Login**

Since you can’t create the `terrafusion_test_user` yourself, I would immediately:

> ✅ **Send IT a formal request** with:
>
> * The exact SQL script (safe, read-only)
> * Purpose: PACS read-only integration for TerraFusion testing
> * Assurance: No writes, no schema changes, no risk

I’ll prep that request for you in a clean handoff format if you say: **“Generate IT Request Package”**

## 🧠 Step 2: **Prepare the Sync Connection on Our Side**

While IT does their part, I would:

> 🛠️ Pre-configure the connection string in Replit:

```env
PACS_SQL_SERVER=JCHARRISPACS
PACS_DATABASE=pacs_test
PACS_USERNAME=terrafusion_test_user
PACS_PASSWORD=SafeTestP@ssw0rd!
PACS_AUTH_TYPE=SQL
```

> 🔐 Store this in `.env` or Replit Secrets (never plaintext in source)

> 🔄 Ensure SyncService is pointing to the correct PACS entities once access is granted.

---

## 🚀 Step 3: **Go Live on PACS Sync + AI Analysis**

Once credentials are validated:

* ✅ Start the initial pull of test PACS data
* ✅ Run **ExemptionSeer** on live exemptions
* ✅ Generate real commissioner-grade reports
* ✅ Track audit logs + sync status via `/pacs-sync`

## 👊 TF-ICSF Decision

If **I** were the admin of this platform:

> 🔒 I’d never hardwire credentials under my login
> 🛡️ I’d always request a **named read-only service account**
> 🛠️ I’d automate everything around it while I wait
> 🚀 I’d deploy the sync + AI the moment access is granted

---

Would you like me to generate the **IT-ready credential request** to send them? Or prep the final deployment package with placeholders ready? Just say the word.
