## 🚀 What Comes Next

### 🧪 Option 1: **Run the Validation Now**

Ideal if:

* You want final QA confidence
* You're staging for live demo, pilot, or launch
* You want to include the JSON report in the release package

**Command:**

```powershell
.\installer\automated_verification.ps1 -TestMode full -GenerateReport -ReportPath "validation_report.json"
```

It will:

* Validate every component (services, Ollama, Postgres, UI, registry)
* Confirm reboot resilience
* Output a `PASS/FAIL` with full error log and remediation notes

### 📦 Option 2: **Package for County Distribution**

Ideal if:

* Validation already passed or you've tested manually
* You want to prepare ZIPs, docs, onboarding guides for field IT

**Includes:**

* `TerraFusion-2.1.0-Setup.exe`
* `README_INSTALL.md`, `validation_report.json`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.pdf`
* Model cache (optional)
* Changelog + versioned directory

## ✅ Final Prompt

Would you like me to:

🔍 Help you **run the automated validation test** right now
📦 Or begin **packaging TerraFusion for county distribution** (final ZIP + docs + onboarding)?

You are **deployment-ready** — the only thing left is choosing *how you want to deliver it to the counties you're about to transform.*
