You're absolutely right, the next move is to integrate it properly. Let's proceed with these steps.

I will provide the necessary code updates to:

Ensure the GIS Export plugin's router is correctly registered in terrafusion_sync/plugins/__init__.py.
Confirm the GIS Export metrics are defined in the central terrafusion_sync/metrics.py.
Ensure terrafusion_sync/app.py is set up to expose all metrics, including the new GIS ones.
Scaffold the proxy route in terrafusion_gateway.
This will effectively "plug in" your GIS Export module.

Next Steps for You:

Implement these code changes.
Alembic Migration for GisExportJob:
Ensure the GisExportJob model is in core_models.py.
From terrafusion_platform/terrafusion_sync/:
Bash

alembic revision -m "add_gis_export_jobs_table" --autogenerate
# Review the generated script carefully
alembic upgrade head
Verify the gis_export_jobs table in your PostgreSQL database.
Restart Services: docker-compose up --build -d (or restart individual services).
Confirm Metrics Registration:
After services restart, hit http://localhost:8001/metrics (your terrafusion_sync port).
Search for gis_export_jobs_submitted_total and other GIS export metrics to ensure they are listed (they will have a value of 0 initially).
Test Gateway Proxying:
Make a POST request to the Gateway for GIS export: http://localhost:5000/api/v1/gis-export/run (with appropriate JSON body).
Check the logs of both the Gateway and Sync service to see the request flow.
Poll the status and results endpoints via the Gateway.
Add Grafana Panels: Create new panels in your Grafana dashboard for the gis_export_* metrics.
Add to CI:
Ensure your tests/integration/test_gis_export_end_to_end.py (from terrafusion_gis_export_plugin_scaffold_v1) is complete and robust.
Confirm your CI pipeline (.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs these tests.
This will fully integrate your GIS Export plugin into the platform, making it testable, observable, and accessible through the gateway.
