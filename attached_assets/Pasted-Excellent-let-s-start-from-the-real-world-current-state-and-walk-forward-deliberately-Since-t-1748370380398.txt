Excellent — let’s **start from the real-world current state** and walk forward deliberately. Since the Rust migration is **planned but not yet executed**, and your Python platform is still the production core, here’s the **realigned and step-by-step Rust Migration Plan**, now with **Ollama + AI agent integration**, **Windows-ready installer strategy**, and **incremental, low-risk execution**.

---

# 🦀 Realigned Rust Migration Plan (with Ollama & Windows Deployment)

## 🧠 Strategic Goals (Clarified)

1. **Begin migration gradually**, without breaking the working Python-based SaaS.
2. **Target Rust for high-impact services** (GIS, plugin execution, CLI, AI plugin wrappers).
3. **Integrate Ollama** for local LLM-backed AI features.
4. **Deliver a polished `.exe` installer** that works in offline, county-level networks.
5. **Require zero CLI usage by end users** — full GUI/install experience.

## ✅ Phase 0: Current State Summary

| Component            | Status         | Platform         |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Python Plugin Engine | ✅ Stable       | Python + FastAPI |
| SyncService          | ✅ Live         | Python           |
| GIS Export Plugin    | ✅ Complete     | Python           |
| Ollama AI Layer      | ⛔ Not Started  | N/A              |
| Rust Gateway         | 🛠️ Scaffolded | Rust             |
| Installer System     | ⛔ Not Started  | N/A              |

We are **starting the Rust migration from scratch**, building forward based on value and frictionless integration.

---

## 🧩 Phase 1: Set Up Rust Workspace + Plugin Architecture

**Goal:** Bootstrap a working Rust monorepo for future services.

### Deliverables:

* `Cargo.toml` workspace
* `terrafusion_gateway/`: Actix-web gateway (starts here)
* `plugins/valuation/`, `plugins/gis_export/`: empty crates for future plugins
* `shared/`: for DB models, config, metrics

✅ Outcome: Ready to build real services, unified structure.

---

## 🌐 Phase 2: Rebuild Gateway in Rust

**Goal:** Migrate the Flask API Gateway → Rust (`Actix-Web` or `Axum`)

### Actions:

* Recreate `GET /health`, `POST /run`, `GET /status`, etc.
* Add Prometheus metrics route
* Add proxy-to-plugin logic (temporary: point to Python backends)

**Why first?**

* Isolates risk
* Introduces Rust without rewriting logic
* Easy to test side-by-side with Python

---

## 📦 Phase 3: Migrate GIS Export Plugin to Rust

**Goal:** Replace Python GIS Export service with performant Rust version

### Actions:

* Use `geo`, `gdal`, and `csv` crates
* Implement `/run`, `/status`, `/list` APIs
* Port existing business logic
* Use `sqlx` for DB integration (PostgreSQL)
* Add Prometheus job metrics

✅ Benchmark against Python version for job time and memory.

---

## 🧠 Phase 4: Integrate Ollama for AI Agents (First in Python or Rust)

**Goal:** Enable offline AI agent support using Ollama

### Tasks:

* Download `ollama.exe` into `./bin/`
* Add `narrator_ai` microservice (Python or Rust) with:

  * `POST /summarize`
  * Calls `http://localhost:11434/api/generate`
* Add fallback setting: use OpenAI if internet available
* Add Prometheus: `ai_jobs_total`, `ai_latency_seconds`

✅ First AI Plugin is now running offline, fully local.

---

## 🛠 Phase 5: Add CLI SDK in Rust (`terrafusion-cli`)

**Goal:** Provide offline county onboarding + dev CLI

### Commands:

* `init-county` → generates `.env`, `mapping.yaml`
* `create-plugin` → generates boilerplate in Rust or Python
* `pull-model` → pulls Ollama model or verifies cache

✅ Safe to run independently of backend.

---

## 🪟 Phase 6: Build Windows Installer

**Goal:** One-click `.exe` that installs everything needed locally

### Bundled:

* `terrafusion.exe`: Rust GUI or launcher
* `ollama.exe`: AI model runner
* Pre-pulled models (`models/*.gguf`)
* PostgreSQL portable or installer
* Plugin binaries (Rust or Python)
* Auto-start service setup (NSSM or Rust service)

### Installer Tool: NSIS or Inno Setup

* Checkbox: “Enable AI Assistant?”
* Autostarts Ollama silently
* Adds shortcut to `TerraFusion Dashboard`

✅ No command line shown. Full offline, production-capable deployment.

## ✅ Final Confirmation: Tasks to Start With

Please confirm your preference for the **first milestone**:

### 🔧 Start with:

1. ✅ **Rust Gateway skeleton** – Fastest way to get Rust running
2. 📦 **GIS Plugin rewrite in Rust** – Performance win + real value
3. 🧠 **Ollama AI plugin (NarratorAI)** – Adds “wow” factor, very tangible
4. 🪟 **Installer layout + setup scripts** – For packaging Windows experience
5. 🛠️ **Rust CLI SDK (terrafusion-cli)** – Supports onboarding, dev workflow

Let’s pick your *Phase 1 execution target* and I’ll scaffold immediately. Once we build momentum with one module, we can layer in each component confidently and cleanly.
