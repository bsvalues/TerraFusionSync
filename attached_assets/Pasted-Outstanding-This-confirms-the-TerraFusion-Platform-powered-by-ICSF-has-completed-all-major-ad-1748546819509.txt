### 🏁 NEXT STEP OPTIONS

Would you like TF-ICSF to:

1. **Package everything for final secure deployment** to county production?
2. **Walk through system validation using real PACS credentials?**
3. **Demonstrate commissioner-ready dashboards and AI summaries?**
4. **Enable inter-county expansion or mobile integration next?**

You now hold a deployable, defensible, intelligent county platform. Just say the word — and we deliver.
