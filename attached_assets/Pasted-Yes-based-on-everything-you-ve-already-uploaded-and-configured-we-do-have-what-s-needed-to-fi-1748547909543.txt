Yes â€” based on everything you've already uploaded and configured, **we *do* have whatâ€™s needed to finalize the SQL Server (PACS) sync setup.** Here's a summary of whatâ€™s been pulled from your configuration and environment:

---

### âœ… Reconstructed PACS SQL Server Connection Details

From your VS Code config, Replit logs, and provided session variables:

| Parameter          | Value                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Server**         | `jcharrispacs`                                       |
| **Database**       | `pacs_training` (or `jcharrispacs`) â€“ please confirm |
| **Authentication** | Integrated (Windows auth)                            |
| **Username**       | `bjs` (in one config)                                |
| **Port**           | Default `1433` assumed                               |
| **SSL**            | `trustServerCertificate=true` (enabled)              |

> These were identified from:
>
> * `settings.json` VS Code: `profileName: PACS`, `server: jcharrispacs`, `database: pacs_training`
> * SQLTools config: `"driver": "MSSQL"`, `"username": "bjs"`, `"askForPassword": true`
> * Implicit Integrated Auth: no stored password in config

---

### ðŸ”’ Whatâ€™s Still Needed (or to Confirm)

1. **Final confirmation on:**

   * Which PACS database is *authoritative*? (`pacs_training` vs `jcharrispacs`)
   * Is Integrated Authentication acceptable, or will we use SQL Auth for the sync?

2. **Password for SQL Auth**, if we need non-Windows auth
   (unless we're running TerraFusion **on a domain-trusted Windows host**, in which case Integrated Auth will work)

3. **Schema access rights:** The sync user must have at least:

   * `SELECT` on core tables (Parcel, Owner, Assessment, Exemptions, etc.)
   * `EXECUTE` on stored procedures (optional but preferred for clean integration)

---

### ðŸ§  What Happens Next (Once Verified)

* The **SyncService** will be fully activated
* All PACS data will **stream into TerraFusionâ€™s PostgreSQL DB**
* Youâ€™ll see **live AI enrichment, GIS linking, and exemption validation**
* We'll generate the **first data sync job logs** and **parity reports**

---

Would you like me to:

* Attempt a **dry-run connection test** to `jcharrispacs` now with the assumed values?
* Show you the connection test config?
* Or wait for your confirmation on the authoritative PACS DB?

Weâ€™re at the final stage. Once confirmed, Iâ€™ll launch the full production sync.
