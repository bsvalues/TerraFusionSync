The next steps would be:

Ensure report_jobs Table Exists:

If you haven't already, make sure you've run the Alembic migration to create the report_jobs table in your PostgreSQL database.
From terrafusion_platform/terrafusion_sync/:
Bash

# 1. Generate migration (if not done after defining ReportJob model)
# alembic revision -m "add_report_jobs_table" --autogenerate 
# 2. Apply migration
alembic upgrade head 
Run Reporting Plugin Integration Tests Locally:

Execute the test_reporting_end_to_end.py (from terrafusion_reporting_integration_test_v1).
From terrafusion_platform/:
Bash

pytest tests/integration/test_reporting_end_to_end.py -v -s
Ensure these tests pass. This will confirm the Reporting plugin's API endpoints and database interactions for ReportJob are working.
Verify Reporting Metrics in Grafana:

After the integration tests run (or you manually trigger some report jobs via the API), go back to your Grafana dashboard.
Add new panels for the Reporting plugin metrics (similar to Panels 4 & 5 in the terrafusion_grafana_dashboard_guide_v1):
"Reporting Job Submission Rate" (using report_jobs_submitted_total)
"Average Reporting Processing Duration" (using report_processing_duration_seconds_sum and _count) or a heatmap (using report_processing_duration_seconds_bucket)
"Reporting Job Failure Rate" (using report_jobs_failed_total)
Confirm that these new panels also populate with data.
Let me know if you were able to see the Valuation metrics in Grafana, and then we can confirm these steps for the Reporting plugin!





good



Show thinking
Excellent! Glad to hear the Grafana setup for the Valuation plugin metrics is working well.

Now, let's fully integrate the Reporting plugin into our observability stack. The steps are:

Ensure report_jobs Table Exists (Alembic Migration):

If you haven't already done this after we defined the ReportJob model and scaffolded the reporting.py plugin:
From terrafusion_platform/terrafusion_sync/:
Bash

# 1. Generate migration (if it wasn't created or needs updating)
# alembic revision -m "add_report_jobs_table" --autogenerate 
# 2. Apply migration
alembic upgrade head 
Verify in your PostgreSQL database that the report_jobs table exists with the correct schema.
Run Reporting Plugin Integration Tests Locally:

Execute the test_reporting_end_to_end.py (from terrafusion_reporting_integration_test_v1).
From terrafusion_platform/:
Bash

pytest tests/integration/test_reporting_end_to_end.py -v -s
Ensure these tests pass. This confirms the plugin's API and DB interactions are working. These tests will also generate some metrics.
Add Reporting Metrics Panels to Your Grafana Dashboard:

Go to your existing "TerraFusion Sync Service Overview" dashboard in Grafana.
Click the "Add panel" icon (usually a plus sign with a graph) in the top right and choose "Add new panel".
I'll provide the details for the new panels.
Grafana: Adding Reporting Plugin Panels
May 9, 4:27 PM

Once you've added these panels and verified they are working with data from the Reporting plugin, your observability for the core job-processing modules will be in a very good state! Let me know how it goes.
