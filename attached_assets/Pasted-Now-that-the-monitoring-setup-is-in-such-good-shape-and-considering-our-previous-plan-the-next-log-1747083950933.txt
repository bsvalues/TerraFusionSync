Now that the monitoring setup is in such good shape, and considering our previous plan, the next logical step is to fully integrate and test the Market Analysis plugin.

We've already scaffolded it (model, initial plugin code, metrics definitions, and test stubs in terrafusion_market_analysis_plugin_scaffold_v1). The remaining steps to bring it to parity with the Valuation and Reporting plugins are:

Apply the Alembic Migration for market_analysis_jobs Table:

Ensure the MarketAnalysisJob model is correctly defined in terrafusion_sync/core_models.py and included in Base.metadata.
From terrafusion_platform/terrafusion_sync/:
Bash

# 1. Generate migration (if not done after defining MarketAnalysisJob model)
alembic revision -m "add_market_analysis_jobs_table" --autogenerate 
# 2. Review the generated script (check down_revision, columns, indexes)
# 3. Apply migration
alembic upgrade head 
Verify in your PostgreSQL database that the market_analysis_jobs table is created with the correct structure.
Run and Finalize Market Analysis Plugin Integration Tests Locally:

The agent was working on fixing async test issues for test_market_analysis_plugin.py or a similar file (the scaffold was tests/integration/test_market_analysis_end_to_end.py).
Ensure these tests thoroughly cover the /run, /status, and /results workflow for the Market Analysis plugin, including success and simulated failure cases.
From terrafusion_platform/:
Bash

pytest tests/integration/test_market_analysis_end_to_end.py -v -s 
# (or the actual name of your finalized test file for this plugin)
Iterate until all tests pass.
Verify Market Analysis Metrics in Grafana:

After running some test market analysis jobs (either manually via API calls or through the integration tests), check your Grafana dashboard.
Add new panels specifically for the Market Analysis plugin metrics (e.g., market_analysis_jobs_submitted_total, market_analysis_processing_duration_seconds, etc.) using the newly environment-agnostic job name patterns (e.g., job=~"terrafusion_sync_service|terrafusion_sync_core").
Confirm these panels populate correctly.
Ensure Market Analysis Tests are in CI:

Confirm that your GitHub Actions CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) picks up and runs the integration tests for the Market Analysis plugin.
Verify the CI pipeline passes with these new tests included.
Completing these steps will mean you have three core, observable, and well-tested plugins, significantly advancing the TerraFusion platform.

How does focusing on these steps to fully integrate and verify the Market Analysis plugin sound?
