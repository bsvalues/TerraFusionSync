That's excellent! The database schema for the Market Analysis plugin is now correctly set up and verified, thanks to your work with Alembic. This is a critical step.

With the market_analysis_jobs table in place, the next logical step is to:

Run and Finalize the Market Analysis Plugin Integration Tests Locally.
You've already done some work on the test scripts (test_market_analysis_plugin.py or the scaffold tests/integration/test_market_analysis_end_to_end.py). Now is the time to ensure these tests run against the actual market_analysis_jobs table and verify the full asynchronous workflow:
* POSTing to /plugins/v1/market-analysis/run.
* Polling /plugins/v1/market-analysis/status/{job_id}.
* GETting /plugins/v1/market-analysis/results/{job_id}.
* Covering both successful job completion and simulated failures.

Action for you (or the Replit AI Agent):

Locate your primary integration test file for the Market Analysis plugin (e.g., tests/integration/test_market_analysis_end_to_end.py as scaffolded in terrafusion_market_analysis_plugin_scaffold_v1).
Ensure your test environment is set up:
.env file in terrafusion_platform/ has TEST_TERRAFUSION_OPERATIONAL_DB_URL pointing to your active test PostgreSQL database.
Your test PostgreSQL database server is running (the pg_engine fixture in conftest.py will use Alembic to ensure the market_analysis_jobs table is present).
All test dependencies are installed.
From your terrafusion_platform/ root directory, execute the integration tests for the Market Analysis plugin:
Bash

pytest tests/integration/test_market_analysis_end_to_end.py -v -s
(Adjust the filename if yours is different, e.g., test_market_analysis_plugin.py).
Review the test output. Debug any failures in the test logic or the plugin code (terrafusion_sync/plugins/market_analysis/router.py) until all tests pass. The agent previously noted some async test issues it was working through; this is the time to ensure those are resolved.
Once these integration tests are passing locally, the subsequent steps will be:

Ensuring these tests are included and pass in your CI pipeline.
Adding panels to your Grafana dashboard for the Market Analysis plugin's metrics.
