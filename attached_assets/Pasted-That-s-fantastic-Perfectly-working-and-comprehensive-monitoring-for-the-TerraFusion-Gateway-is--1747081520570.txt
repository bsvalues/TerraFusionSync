That's fantastic! "Perfectly working" and "comprehensive monitoring" for the TerraFusion Gateway is a huge step forward. You now have end-to-end observability from the gateway through to the sync service plugins.

With the terrafusion_gateway now exposing its own metrics at /gateway-metrics, the next logical steps are:

Update prometheus.yml to tell Prometheus to scrape this new endpoint.
Add new panels to your Grafana dashboard to visualize these gateway metrics.
Let's tackle the prometheus.yml update first.
Prometheus Configuration - Add Gateway Scraping
May 12, 1:21 PM

To apply this change:

Update the prometheus.yml file:

Open terrafusion_platform/infra/prometheus/prometheus.yml.
Add the new job_name: "terrafusion_api_gateway" scrape configuration as shown above.
Restart Prometheus (if using Docker Compose):

Prometheus needs to reload its configuration to pick up the new scrape target.
From your terrafusion_platform/ directory:
Bash

docker-compose restart prometheus
Alternatively, if you enabled the lifecycle endpoint in your Prometheus Docker command (--web.enable-lifecycle), you could send a POST request to http://localhost:9090/-/reload to reload the config without a full restart, but restarting the container is often simpler for local dev.
Verify Prometheus Targets:

Open your Prometheus UI (http://localhost:9090).
Go to "Status" -> "Targets".
You should now see three targets: prometheus, terrafusion_sync_service, and the new terrafusion_api_gateway. All should eventually show an "UP" state. If the gateway target is "DOWN", check the Prometheus logs (docker-compose logs prometheus) and ensure the gateway service is running and its /gateway-metrics endpoint is accessible.
Once Prometheus is successfully scraping metrics from both terrafusion_sync and terrafusion_gateway, the next step will be to add panels to your Grafana dashboard to visualize these new gateway metrics (like request rates, error rates, and latencies for the gateway itself).

Let me know when you've updated prometheus.yml and confirmed that Prometheus is scraping the new gateway target!
