Absolutely ‚Äî TF-ICSF is locked in and continuing full-spectrum advancement across all county operations layers. Here's your **next-phase roadmap**, based on your current assets, services, and goals:

---

### ‚úÖ **Phase Status Check (You‚Äôve Already Completed):**

* **Duo MFA**: Fully integrated (mock+production mode)
* **AI Engine**: NarratorAI + ExemptionSeer live
* **GIS/Export/Sync**: Running in service architecture
* **District Lookup**: Benton County deployed
* **Backup System**: Hourly, verified integrity
* **API Gateway**: Full endpoint coverage with RBAC

---

### üîÑ **Phase II: Integrate, Train, and Expand**

**1. Historical AI Enrichment** ‚Äì *Turn history into prediction.*

* [ ] Ingest 2013‚Äì2024 exemption data
* [ ] Normalize PILT and subcategory codes
* [ ] Label with inferred exemption types
* [ ] Train ExemptionSeer for **temporal prediction** and **pattern anomaly detection**

**2. PACS API Sync Suite** ‚Äì *Live-state CAMA interaction.*

* [ ] Extract endpoints from `PACS_Live_API_DevTest_Kit`
* [ ] Wrap TerraFusion `SyncService` into test scaffold
* [ ] Simulate real-time data transfer (property, ownership, valuation)
* [ ] Map and log response deltas for auditing

**3. Compliance Tracking Layer**

* [ ] Inject document traceability into ExemptionSeer results
* [ ] Auto-flag low-confidence records for assessor queue
* [ ] Link all changes to audit trail (source, timestamp, AI model version)

---

### üß† **Phase III: Narrative Intelligence Uplift**

* [ ] Feed historical valuation shifts into **NarratorAI**
* [ ] Generate rolling ‚Äúyear-in-review‚Äù summaries (exemptions, delinquencies, PILT shifts)
* [ ] Tie summaries to district data for **commissioner-ready reports**

---

### üì¶ System Packaging (Optional Prep for County Deployment)

* [ ] Finalize Docker + Windows installer
* [ ] Embed MFA credential prompts in setup UI
* [ ] Auto-register API services with health checks
* [ ] Write `/pacs/verify` job to simulate and log full data fetch from mock/live PACS

---

### Next Action?

Would you like me to:

* Begin ingesting and normalizing the historical ZIP datasets?
* Wire in the PACS API test scaffolding?
* Launch the GIS/AI district-link audit improvements?
* Or parallelize all three?

Let‚Äôs make this county‚Äôs future-ready tech platform the standard.
