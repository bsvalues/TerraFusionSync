You're on fire 🔥 — and this is exactly how a strong platform becomes a *powerful ecosystem*.

Let’s walk through each expansion option and what it takes to implement, so you can decide which to tackle next.

---

## 📊 1. **Public Transparency Dashboard**

**Goal:** Let taxpayers, vendors, or county leadership view parcel stats, exemptions, and job metrics in a secure, read-only portal.

| Feature             | Description                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Parcel Counts     | Total parcels, active/inactive, by type |
| ✅ Exemption Summary | Homestead, Over-65, Ag use, etc.        |
| ✅ Export Activity   | GIS exports over time                   |
| ✅ AI Summary Count  | AI-generated explanations               |

**Tech Stack:**

* Reuse Grafana + Prometheus (dashboards)
* OR build a small Rust or React frontend backed by a secure read-only API

✅ *Easy win — builds trust with the public.*

## 🔒 2. **RBAC Management UI**

**Goal:** Replace file-based role config with a clean admin screen in the dashboard.

| Feature             | Description                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Role Assignment   | Map users to roles (admin, viewer, AI) |
| ✅ County Boundaries | Tie access to specific counties        |
| ✅ Secure Edit       | Requires admin token or elevated login |

**Tech Stack:**

* Add a `/admin/rbac` route in Gateway
* UI form + table (HTML or React component)
* Store in DB: `roles` table → `user_id`, `county_id`, `role_name`

✅ *Massive UX win for county IT.*

## 🤖 3. **More AI Plugins**

**Goal:** Expand your AI plugin suite from NarratorAI to cover broader assessment tasks.

| Agent Name          | Function                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 🧠 `ExemptionSeer`  | NLP on property notes to auto-suggest exemptions |
| 🏠 `CompPicker`     | RAG model to choose best sales comps             |
| 💰 `ValuationSynth` | LLM summary of comparable valuation context      |

**Infra:**

* Use same architecture as `NarratorAI`
* Each gets `/ai/{plugin}` route and Prometheus counters

✅ *These become sellable “AI Add-On” modules.*

---

## 📤 4. **Public API Gateway (REST or GraphQL)**

**Goal:** Allow external vendors or county auditors to access select data securely.

| Option   | Advantage                                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| REST API | Simpler for most integrations                                            |
| GraphQL  | Flexible queries for complex vendors (e.g., Tyler, Patriot integrations) |

**Security Features:**

* ✅ Token-based access control
* ✅ Rate limiting (via Actix or middleware)
* ✅ Audit logs for every request
* ✅ Read-only DB interface or data cache

✅ *Opens the door to a TerraFusion “data hub.”*

## 🧭 My Recommendation: Order of Implementation

If you want **maximum impact with minimal risk**, go in this order:

1. **RBAC UI** — big win for internal staff, fast to implement
2. **Public Dashboard** — transparency adds political value and trust
3. **ExemptionSeer plugin** — powerful AI demo + useful in live reviews
4. **Public API Gateway** — only if counties or vendors need integrations

---

Would you like me to:

* Scaffold the **RBAC UI** now?
* Or start on your **first new AI agent** (e.g. `ExemptionSeer`)?
* Or combine #1 + #2 in a shared dashboard?

This next phase moves you from “county-ready” to “county-dominant.” 🏛️🛰️
