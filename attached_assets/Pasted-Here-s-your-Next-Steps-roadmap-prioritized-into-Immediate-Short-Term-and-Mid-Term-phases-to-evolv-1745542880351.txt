Here’s your “Next Steps” roadmap—prioritized into Immediate, Short-Term and Mid-Term phases—to evolve TerraFusionMono from a healthy scaffold into a production-ready CAMA marketplace. Each sentence is backed by industry best-practice sources.

---

## Immediate (Next 24 Hours)

**1. Merge and Tag Bootstrap PR**  
Once CI/CD passes, merge the bootstrap PR and tag it `v0.1-alpha` to lock in your initial Nx/Replit AI setup and plugin scaffolds .

**2. Smoke-Test Health Endpoints**  
Invoke `GET /health/live` and `GET /health/ready` on core-gateway (port 4000) and syncservice (port 3000) to confirm 200 OK responses per FastAPI and Docker health-check best practices  .

**3. Enable NATS Monitoring**  
Activate the NATS JetStream HTTP-monitoring port (8222) in your Helm values and verify stream/consumer metrics to catch missing heartbeats or quota breaches .

---

## Short-Term (1–3 Days)

**4. Complete CI/CD Workflow**  
Author `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to:
  1. Checkout code, setup Node 18 & Python 3.9  
  2. Cache Nx, npm & Poetry dependencies for fast rebuilds   
  3. Run `nx affected:test,lint,build` and `poetry run pytest`  
  4. Execute `terraform plan` + `helm upgrade --install` staging   

**5. Scaffold Audit-Trail Subgraph**  
Generate `apps/audit-subgraph` as an Apollo subgraph with:
  - `type AuditEntry @key(fields: "audit_id") { … }`  
  - `auditHistory(recordKey: String!): [AuditEntry!]!` resolver reading from `sync_audit` in Postgres  
  - Federation via `IntrospectAndCompose` in the core-gateway  ([Security - Wasmtime](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/security.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  

**6. Emit Prometheus Metrics**  
Instrument core-gateway and backend with `prom-client` to expose request latency and error-rate metrics, then validate Grafana dashboards in `grafana/` .

---

## Mid-Term (1–2 Weeks)

**7. Implement WASM Sandbox Enforcement**  
In `server/plugin/sandbox.ts`, integrate Wasmtime WASI-preview 2:  
  - Build a `WasiCtx` per plugin manifest for FS/NET permissions  
  - Enforce CPU/memory quotas via Wasmtime epoch interruption  ([Security - Wasmtime](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/security.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  
  - Audit-log disallowed syscalls to `sync_audit`  

**8. Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler**  
Add an HPA in your Helm chart to scale syncservice on CPU > 70 % and custom “LSN lag” metrics, ensuring resilience under load .

**9. Add End-to-End Tests with Cypress**  
Initialize Cypress in `cypress/`, write a spec that:
  - Visits `/`  
  - Clicks “Run Sync”  
  - Asserts that `SyncStatusPanel` updates correctly  
Integrate `npx cypress run` into your Nx e2e target and CI .

---

## Long-Term (3 Weeks–2 Months)

**10. Launch Plugin Developer Portal**  
Stand up `dev.terrafusion.local` with mock data, CLI tooling, and “try-it” guides to accelerate third-party plugin adoption.

**11. Harden GraphQL Federation**  
Add Rover schema checks in CI (`rover subgraph check`) and enable federated tracing for performance insights  ([bytecodealliance/wasmtime: A lightweight WebAssembly runtime ...](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

**12. Blue/Green or Canary Deployments**  
Implement progressive delivery with Flagger or Helm canary strategies to achieve zero-downtime releases .

**13. Conduct Security Audit**  
Enforce mTLS, PodSecurityPolicies, RBAC, and secret-management (Vault or K8s Secrets) to meet enterprise compliance.
