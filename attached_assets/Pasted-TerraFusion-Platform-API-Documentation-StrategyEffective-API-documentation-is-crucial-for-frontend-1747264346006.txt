TerraFusion Platform - API Documentation StrategyEffective API documentation is crucial for frontend developers, external integrators, and for maintaining the platform. Our strategy leverages both automated tools and manual efforts.1. terrafusion_sync (FastAPI Service & Plugins)Primary Method: Auto-generated OpenAPI (Swagger UI and ReDoc).How it Works: FastAPI automatically generates an OpenAPI schema from your Pydantic models, path operation decorators (@router.post, @router.get, etc.), type hints, and docstrings.Access:Swagger UI: Typically available at /docs relative to the service root (e.g., http://localhost:8001/docs for the main app, or http://localhost:8001/plugins/v1/valuation/docs if plugins were separate FastAPI apps, though with included routers, it's usually one main /docs for the whole terrafusion_sync app).ReDoc: Typically available at /redoc.Enhancements:Descriptive Docstrings: Write clear, detailed docstrings for all path operations and Pydantic models. These appear directly in the generated documentation.Pydantic Field Descriptions: Use Field(..., description="...") in your Pydantic models for detailed field explanations.Tags: Use tags=["Plugin Name"] in your APIRouter or path operations to group related endpoints in the documentation.Examples: Provide examples in Pydantic models using Field(..., example=...) or in path operation docstrings.Response Models: Clearly define response_model for all path operations to show exact response structures.2. terrafusion_gateway (Flask Service)Primary Method: Manual documentation combined with potential tool assistance. Flask does not have the same level of built-in OpenAPI generation as FastAPI.Options & Strategy:Markdown Files: Maintain API documentation in Markdown files within the docs/api/gateway/ directory. This can be version-controlled alongside the code.Structure: Organize by resource or functionality (e.g., auth_api.md, valuation_proxy_api.md).Content: For each endpoint, detail:HTTP Method and Path (e.g., POST /api/v1/valuation/run).Description.Request Headers (e.g., Authorization: Bearer <JWT>).Request Body (JSON schema or examples).Success Responses (status codes, JSON schema/examples).Error Responses (status codes, JSON schema/examples).Required Permissions (RBAC).Swagger/OpenAPI Tools for Flask: Explore libraries that can help generate or integrate OpenAPI specifications with Flask applications:flasgger: A popular choice that uses Marshmallow schemas or YAML to define specs.flask-restx (formerly Flask-RESTPlus): Provides tools for structuring APIs and generating Swagger documentation.This would involve decorating Flask routes or defining schemas separately.Postman Collections: Create and maintain a Postman collection that documents all gateway endpoints with examples. This can be exported and shared.Chosen Approach (Initial): Start with Markdown files for clarity and ease of maintenance. As the API surface stabilizes, evaluate integrating a tool like flasgger to generate a live OpenAPI spec.3. Overall API Documentation Portal (Future)Consider using a documentation generator tool (e.g., Sphinx with appropriate extensions, Docusaurus, MkDocs) to combine the auto-generated OpenAPI specs from terrafusion_sync and the Markdown/generated specs from terrafusion_gateway into a single, searchable, and user-friendly documentation portal.This portal would be the central reference for all TerraFusion Platform APIs.4. VersioningAPI endpoints should be versioned (e.g., /api/v1/...) to allow for future non-breaking changes.Documentation must clearly indicate the version of the API it describes.By combining FastAPI's excellent auto-documentation capabilities with a structured approach for the Flask gateway, we can provide comprehensive and useful API documentation.
