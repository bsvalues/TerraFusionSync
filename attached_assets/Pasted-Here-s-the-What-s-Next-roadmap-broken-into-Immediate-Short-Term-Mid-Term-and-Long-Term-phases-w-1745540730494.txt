Here’s the “What’s Next” roadmap—broken into Immediate, Short-Term, Mid-Term, and Long-Term phases—with concrete tasks, timelines, and best-practice citations. Each step builds on the deep-dive findings to turn TerraFusionMono into a rock-solid, production-grade platform.  

**Key Findings Summary:**  
You’ve bootstrapped an Nx monorepo hosting a federated GraphQL gateway, backend sync service, and UI shell with GIS and levy-calc plugins. Core scaffolding exists, but critical gaps remain in CI/CD, health-checks, observability, sandbox security, audit-trail federation, and testing. Addressing these in priority order will de-risk your platform and accelerate delivery.

**Next Immediate Prompt for Replit AI Agent:**

```text
“Implement the CI workflow: create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` as specified in the Short-Term plan (step 1), including Nx caching, Poetry tests, Terraform plan, and Helm deploy.”
```

Use that to kick off the next automated PR.
