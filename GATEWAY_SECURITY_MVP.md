# TerraFusion Platform - Gateway Security MVP Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Gateway Security MVP, which is the next priority after the GIS Export plugin.

## Overview

The Gateway Security MVP focuses on securing the TerraFusion Platform through robust authentication, authorization, and audit logging mechanisms. This security layer will protect all API endpoints, enforce proper access controls, and maintain a comprehensive audit trail for compliance purposes.

## Implementation Goals

1. Implement robust authentication for all API endpoints
2. Establish role-based access control (RBAC) for granular permissions
3. Create comprehensive audit logging for security events
4. Ensure county-specific data isolation
5. Provide security monitoring and alerting capabilities

## Technical Components

### 1. Authentication System

- **JWT Token Management**
  - Token issuance, validation, and revocation
  - Secure token storage and transmission
  - Token refresh and expiration handling

- **Multi-factor Authentication**
  - Email verification for password resets
  - Time-based one-time password (TOTP) support
  - Security question verification

### 2. Authorization Framework

- **Role-Based Access Control**
  - Predefined roles (Admin, Manager, Operator, Viewer)
  - Custom role creation and management
  - Permission inheritance and hierarchy

- **Permission Definitions**
  - Resource-specific permissions (e.g., `view_sync_pairs`, `run_gis_export`)
  - Operation permissions (create, read, update, delete)
  - Administrative permissions

### 3. County-Based Data Isolation

- **County Assignment System**
  - Users assigned to specific counties
  - Multi-county access for administrative users
  - County-specific role assignments

- **Request Validation**
  - Validate county access on all requests
  - Prevent cross-county data access
  - Filter results based on county assignments

### 4. Audit Logging Enhancements

- **Security Event Logging**
  - Authentication attempts (success/failure)
  - Permission changes and role assignments
  - Security-sensitive operations

- **Compliance Reporting**
  - Exportable audit logs for compliance review
  - Tamper-evident log storage
  - Long-term audit retention policy

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Authentication Infrastructure

1. Implement JWT token generation and validation
2. Create login, logout, and token refresh endpoints
3. Establish token-based session management
4. Implement password policy enforcement

### Phase 2: Authorization Framework

1. Define core roles and permissions
2. Implement RBAC database schema
3. Create role and permission management UI
4. Add middleware for permission checking

### Phase 3: Security Integration

1. Secure all existing endpoints with RBAC
2. Implement county-based access controls
3. Add comprehensive security logging
4. Create admin security dashboard

### Phase 4: Testing and Hardening

1. Conduct security penetration testing
2. Implement automated security scanning
3. Address security findings and vulnerabilities
4. Document security architecture and controls

## Implementation Timeline

- Phase 1: May 22-26, 2025
- Phase 2: May 27-31, 2025
- Phase 3: June 1-5, 2025
- Phase 4: June 6-10, 2025

## Dependencies

- Completed GIS Export plugin integration
- Database schema modifications for RBAC
- Authentication service dependencies
- Security monitoring infrastructure

## Metrics for Success

- 100% of endpoints protected by authentication
- Role and permission system fully implemented
- Comprehensive audit logging for all security events
- Successful security penetration testing
- Documentation and training materials completed
