# TerraFusion SyncService Architecture

## System Overview

TerraFusion SyncService is a robust platform designed for enterprise data migration and synchronization across multiple systems. It employs a microservice architecture to ensure scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

## Core Components

### 1. API Gateway (Flask)

The API Gateway serves as the primary entry point for all client requests. Built with Flask, it provides:

- **Unified API Surface**: A consistent API for clients regardless of backend changes
- **Request Routing**: Directs requests to the appropriate SyncService endpoints
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Manages API keys and user permissions
- **Service Monitoring**: Tracks SyncService availability and health
- **Auto-Recovery**: Detects and restarts the SyncService if it stops responding
- **Logging & Metrics Collection**: Captures operational data for analysis

### 2. SyncService (FastAPI)

The SyncService is the core business logic component, handling the actual data synchronization. Built with FastAPI, it provides:

- **Sync Operations**: Performs full and incremental syncs between systems
- **Data Transformation**: Maps data between different system schemas
- **Validation & Error Handling**: Ensures data integrity during transfers
- **Health Monitoring**: Reports detailed system resource usage
- **Self-Healing**: Recovers from transient failures automatically

### 3. Database (PostgreSQL)

The PostgreSQL database stores configuration, operational data, and metrics:

- **Configuration Management**: Stores sync pair configurations
- **Operation History**: Records details of all sync operations
- **Performance Metrics**: Captures timing and resource usage data
- **Error Logs**: Stores detailed error information for troubleshooting

## Error Handling Strategy

TerraFusion SyncService implements a multi-layered error handling strategy:

1. **Defensive Programming**: All components use defensive coding with proper exception handling
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Services fail gracefully with informative error messages
3. **Automatic Retry**: Transient failures are automatically retried with backoff
4. **Error Escalation**: Persistent errors are logged and escalated for intervention
5. **Self-Healing**: The system attempts to recover from common failure scenarios
6. **Fallback Responses**: Even in error conditions, endpoints return useful information

## Monitoring and Metrics

The system collects comprehensive metrics at multiple levels:

1. **System Resources**: CPU, memory, disk usage, and network activity
2. **Operation Performance**: Duration, records processed, success/failure rates
3. **API Metrics**: Request counts, response times, error rates
4. **Business Metrics**: Sync frequency, data volume, integration status

## Data Flow

### Full Sync Process

1. Client requests a full sync via API Gateway
2. API Gateway authenticates and forwards to SyncService
3. SyncService creates a new operation record in the database
4. SyncService connects to source system and extracts all data
5. Data is transformed to target system format
6. SyncService connects to target system and applies data
7. Results are recorded in the database
8. API Gateway returns operation status to client

### Incremental Sync Process

1. Client requests an incremental sync via API Gateway
2. API Gateway authenticates and forwards to SyncService
3. SyncService creates a new operation record in the database
4. SyncService queries source system for changes since last sync
5. Changed data is transformed to target system format
6. SyncService connects to target system and applies changes
7. Results are recorded in the database
8. API Gateway returns operation status to client

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Authentication**: All API requests require valid API keys
- **HTTPS Encryption**: All communication is encrypted via HTTPS
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Services run with minimal required permissions
- **Audit Logging**: All actions are logged for accountability

## Deployment Architecture

For production environments, the system is designed to be deployed as separate services:

- API Gateway on dedicated app servers
- SyncService on separate worker servers
- PostgreSQL on managed database servers

This separation allows independent scaling of each component based on load requirements.
