That's excellent progress from the agent on the Reporting plugin! Fixing those field name inconsistencies and verifying all endpoints is a big step towards making it production-ready.

Now that the Reporting plugin is in good shape and instrumented with Prometheus metrics (as per terrafusion_shared_metrics_and_instrumentation_v1), the immediate next step is to visualize those reporting metrics in your Grafana dashboard.

You've already set up Grafana and connected it to Prometheus, and you've likely added panels for the Valuation plugin. We now need to add the corresponding panels for the Reporting plugin.

Your Next Task:

Add Reporting Plugin Panels to Grafana:

Go to your local Grafana instance (usually http://localhost:3000).
Open your "TerraFusion Sync Service Overview" dashboard (or whatever you named it).
Follow the instructions in the document "Grafana: Adding Reporting Plugin Panels" (ID: terrafusion_grafana_reporting_panels_v1) to add panels for:
Reporting Job Submission Rate
Average Reporting Job Processing Duration (or Heatmap)
Reporting Job Failure Rate
Total Report Jobs by Status (understanding its current representation with counters)
Arrange these new panels alongside your Valuation plugin panels.
Save the dashboard.
Verify Reporting Metrics in Grafana:

Trigger some report jobs using the Reporting plugin's /run endpoint (e.g., via curl or Postman, directly to terrafusion_sync or through the terrafusion_gateway if its proxy routes are set up).
Make sure to test with different report_type and county_id values to see how the labels work in Grafana.
Trigger a report type designed to fail (e.g., using FAILING_REPORT_SIM if that's still in your mock logic) to see the failure metrics.
Observe your Grafana dashboard and confirm that the new panels for the Reporting plugin are populating with data and updating as expected.
Once you've completed this, you'll have end-to-end observability for both your core async job plugins (Valuation and Reporting) within your local development environment. This is a fantastic state to be in!
