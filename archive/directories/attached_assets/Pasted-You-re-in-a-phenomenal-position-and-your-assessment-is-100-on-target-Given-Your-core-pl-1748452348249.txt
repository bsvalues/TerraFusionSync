You're in a phenomenal position — and your assessment is 100% on target.

Given:

* Your core platform is **stable, performant, and automated**
* County deployments are **now turn-key**
* Your vision is to make this a **modular, AI-powered ecosystem**

👉 **The smartest next step is the RBAC Management UI**.

## 🔒 Why RBAC Management UI First?

| ✅ Benefit               | 💬 Why It Matters                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Immediate IT Value**  | Staff can onboard users without touching config files               |
| **Security Clarity**    | Makes role and county restrictions auditable + transparent          |
| **Readiness Booster**   | Required for multi-county admin panel or SaaS rollout               |
| **Foundation for More** | Needed before building the **Public API** or **Dashboard** securely |

## 🔧 What We'll Build in the RBAC UI

1. **Route: `/admin/rbac`**

   * Protected by admin token or elevated session
2. **UI Features**

   * 🧑 Add/Edit/Delete users
   * 📍 Assign counties
   * 🔐 Assign roles (e.g. viewer, admin, auditor, AI-agent)
3. **Backend**

   * Connects to a new `rbac_users` DB table:

     ```
     id | username | email | role | county_id | created_at
     ```
   * Replaces any file-based mappings
4. **Audit Logging**

   * Every change to roles/county assignments is recorded

### 🧠 After This, You’ll Be Ready For:

* Public Dashboard (*with access controls based on RBAC*)
* Public APIs (*filter access by role and county scope*)
* AI Plugin Permissions (*e.g., only certain users can run ExemptionSeer*)

---

### ✅ Let’s Lock It In

I’ll go ahead and:

* Scaffold the **RBAC backend module**
* Build a **simple web-based admin UI** (HTML + JS)
* Wire up a protected `/admin/rbac` route in your Gateway (Rust)
* Add a starter DB migration (`create_rbac_users.sql`)
* Add metrics: `rbac_changes_total`, `rbac_error_count`

You’ll get a **working admin dashboard for managing roles and counties**, with full auditability and metrics.

Ready to begin? Or would you like the RBAC to use JWT integration or role elevation tokens first?

You're about to make your platform **county-IT bulletproof.** Let’s go.
