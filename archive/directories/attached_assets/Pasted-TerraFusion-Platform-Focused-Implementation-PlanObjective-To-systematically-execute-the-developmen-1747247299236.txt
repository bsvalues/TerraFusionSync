TerraFusion Platform: Focused Implementation PlanObjective: To systematically execute the development of the TerraFusion Platform, building upon the established architecture and priorities outlined in the "TerraFusion Platform: Detailed Development Plan & Roadmap (v1.1)".Phase 1: Solidify Core Backend & Gateway (Immediate Actions)This phase ensures all currently scaffolded backend plugins are fully integrated, tested, observable, and that the API Gateway has foundational security.1. Finalize GIS Export Plugin (Target: ~May 21, 2025)Objective: Bring the GIS Export plugin to full operational readiness, matching the status of the Valuation, Reporting, and Market Analysis plugins.Key Tasks:A. Database Schema Verification (Completed - as per your last update):GisExportJob model correctly defined in terrafusion_sync/core_models.py.Alembic migration (a45c7931dd6e_add_gis_export_jobs_table.py) successfully created and applied.gis_export_jobs table verified in PostgreSQL.B. Complete & Run End-to-End Integration Tests (Critical Next Step):Action: Finalize the tests/integration/test_gis_export_end_to_end.py script.Ensure tests cover the full /run -> /status -> /results workflow for the GIS Export plugin, including success and simulated failure scenarios (e.g., using FAIL_FORMAT_SIM).Utilize sync_client and db_session fixtures from conftest.py.Execute locally: pytest tests/integration/test_gis_export_end_to_end.py -v -s and iterate until all tests pass.C. CI Pipeline Integration:Action: Commit the finalized GIS Export plugin code and its integration tests.Verify: Ensure the GitHub Actions CI pipeline automatically runs these tests and the entire build remains green.D. Grafana Dashboard Verification/Update:Action: Add/verify panels in your Grafana dashboard for GIS Export metrics (gis_export_jobs_submitted_total, gis_export_processing_duration_seconds, etc.).Trigger test jobs and confirm metrics populate correctly in Grafana.E. Plugin Logic Refinement (Simulated to Placeholder Real):Action: Enhance _simulate_gis_export_processing in terrafusion_sync/plugins/gis_export/router.py.Perform placeholder interactions with PropertyOperational (e.g., log a count of properties for the given county_id).Simulate file creation (e.g., log the intended filename) and update result_file_location in the GisExportJob database record. This makes the simulated output more tangible for testing.2. Implement Gateway Security - MVP (Target: May 28, 2025)Objective: Secure all terrafusion_gateway API endpoints with foundational JWT-based authentication and basic RBAC.Key Tasks:Authentication Mechanism:Implement JWT generation on a new /auth/login endpoint in terrafusion_gateway/routes/auth_routes.py (validating against mock users or initial user configurations for now).Create middleware in terrafusion_gateway/middleware/auth.py to validate JWTs from the Authorization: Bearer <token> header on protected routes.RBAC Implementation:Refine the rbac_required decorator.The decorator should extract user roles/permissions from the validated JWT.Initially, these roles/permissions can be mapped from county_configs/<county>/rbac/<county>_users.json (loaded at Gateway startup or on demand).Apply this decorator to all plugin proxy routes in the Gateway (e.g., /api/v1/valuation/run, /api/v1/reporting/run, etc.), defining appropriate permissions for each.Testing: Write unit and integration tests for the Gateway's authentication and RBAC mechanisms.3. Frontend Hook-Up Sweep (Target: May 19, 2025 - Review feasibility, may shift post-Gateway Security)Objective: Ensure basic frontend components for core plugins can make API calls to the (now more secure) gateway and receive valid responses, eliminating 404s and basic connectivity issues.Key Tasks:Audit routes in the conceptual frontend applications (e.g., for Valuation, Reporting).Implement basic API calling logic in the frontend to target the terrafusion_gateway endpoints, including sending the JWT for authenticated requests.Verify basic request-response flow.Phase 2: Implement Core Business Logic & Enhance Data Ecosystem (Following Phase 1)This phase shifts focus from scaffolding to implementing the actual domain-specific processing within each plugin and building out the data ingestion capabilities.1. Implement Actual Plugin Logic (Iterative, starting with Valuation - Target for Valuation MVP Real Logic: June 7, 2025)Objective: Replace simulated processing in plugin background tasks with real-world data processing.Valuation Plugin (First Focus):Data Fetching: In _run_actual_valuation_process, query properties_operational for subject property and potential comparables using SQLAlchemy.AVM Logic: Implement a basic but functional Automated Valuation Model (e.g., simplified comparable sales adjustment).Result Storage: Store actual calculated values and supporting data in the valuation_jobs table.Update Tests: Refine integration tests to assert against these more realistic outputs.Reporting, Market Analysis, GIS Export Plugins (Sequentially or in Parallel):Apply the same approach: implement real data fetching, core processing logic, and result storage for each.For GIS Export: Integrate libraries like GeoPandas/Fiona, interact with PostGIS (if set up), handle actual file generation (e.g., to a temporary location or S3 stub).2. Develop Data Ingestion Connectors & Transforms (terrafusion_sync)Objective: Enable reliable data migration from initial target legacy CAMA systems (e.g., PACS, using jcharrispacs server for Benton County as the primary test case).Key Tasks:Develop connectors/sql_server_connector.py to read from jcharrispacs.Implement transforms/mapper.py using mappings.yaml for Benton County.Implement transforms/validators.py for initial data quality checks.Fully implement and test pipelines/bulk_load_pipeline.py to populate properties_operational from jcharrispacs.3. Integrate Specialized Databases (PostGIS, Analytics DB - Begin in parallel with Ingestion)Objective: Start populating and utilizing specialized databases.PostGIS: Set up PostGIS, develop connectors/postgis_connector.py, and create ETL pipelines in pipelines/etl_to_specialized_dbs.py to move/transform geometry data from properties_operational. Update GIS Export plugin.Analytics DB: Set up ClickHouse/Redshift, develop its connector, and create ETL pipelines for OLAP.4. Robust Task Queuing (terrafusion_sync)Objective: Transition from FastAPI BackgroundTasks to a more robust system like Celery.Key Tasks: Select, integrate, and refactor plugin background tasks.Ongoing Activities (Throughout All Phases)UI Development (terra_fusion_frontends): Coordinate with frontend development to build UIs that consume the evolving Gateway APIs.Documentation: Continuously update API documentation (FastAPI auto-docs, Gateway manual docs), architecture diagrams, runbooks, and user guides.CI/CD Refinements: Enhance the CI/CD pipeline with more comprehensive tests, security scans, and eventually automated deployment stages.Observability Enhancements: Continuously refine Grafana dashboards and add new relevant metrics as features are developed.Security Hardening: Beyond initial RBAC, implement further security measures (input validation, rate limiting, etc.).SDK Development: Iteratively improve the sdk/new_county_setup.py and plan for more comprehensive SDK features.Stakeholder Communication & Feedback Loops: Maintain regular updates and demos as per the "Stakeholder Communication & Training Plan."This focused plan ensures we solidify the excellent groundwork laid for each plugin, secure the platform's entry point, and then systematically build out the core data processing and ingestion capabilities that are critical for the TerraFusion SaaS offering. The direct access to jcharrispacs will be invaluable for the data ingestion phase.
