Excellent — resuming AI workflow enhancements for **ExemptionSeer** and **NarratorAI**. Here's our updated strategy, focusing on **county operations intelligence**, **property audit automation**, and **compliance support**.

## 🧠 AI Workflow Reinitialization Plan

### ✅ Current State Recap

#### **ExemptionSeer**

* ✅ Deployed: `/api/v1/ai/analyze/exemption`
* ✅ Supports: PDF/image parsing, exemption classification, fraud risk scoring
* ✅ Output: Confidence level, reason code, assessor recommendation
* ✅ Dashboard: `/ai-analysis` live UI

#### **NarratorAI**

* ✅ Deployed: `/api/v1/ai/analyze/gis-export`
* ✅ Supports: Natural language property summaries
* ✅ GIS dataset analyzer for trends, anomalies
* ✅ Narratives injected into GIS export workflows

## 🚀 Immediate Enhancements Queue

### 1. 🔍 **Expanded Classification Schema**

We will now add **more nuanced property classification models**:

* `Religious`, `Charitable`, `Educational`, `Senior Citizen`, `Veteran`, `Agricultural`
* Risk indicator overlay: missing docs, valuation anomalies, temporal misalignments

### 2. 📎 **Document Ingestion Engine**

* Enhance with OCR for scanned documents (PDF/Image)
* Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract: org names, owner names, exemption basis
* Add audit flagging logic: "Not a recognized 501(c)(3)", "Parcel not zoned EDU", etc.

### 3. 🧾 **Audit Trail Enhancements**

* Tie every prediction to an `AuditEvent`
* Create `/api/v1/ai/audit-trail` for exemption-based queries:

  * Inputs, model decision, timestamp, risk score, assessor override (if any)

### 4. 🔄 **GIS-AI Feedback Loop (NarratorAI)**

* Auto-generate natural language summaries per district export:

  * Parcel growth, exemption trends, usage changes
* Style example:

  > "In District 4, there was a 14% year-over-year increase in religious exemptions, with 4 flagged for reassessment due to zoning conflicts."

## ⚙️ Next Tasks for Immediate Execution

1. `expand_exemption_model.py` – integrate new classes + retrain
2. `ocr_exemption_docs.py` – hook into AI pipeline
3. `audit_logger.py` – real-time logging and exposure API
4. `narrator_summary_gen.py` – connects NarratorAI to GIS exports

I’ll now begin updating and deploying these AI modules. You’ll soon see:

* 🧠 Smarter exemption classifications
* 🔍 Full audit trails for each prediction
* 🗂️ Document ingestion (PDF/Image) live testing
* 🗣️ NarratorAI summarizing county data weekly

Would you like a **live example exemption report**, a **NarratorAI demo export summary**, or just let me run the backend AI deployment pipeline now?
