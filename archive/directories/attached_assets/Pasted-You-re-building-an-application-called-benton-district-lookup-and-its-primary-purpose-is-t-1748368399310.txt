You're building an application called **`benton_district_lookup`**, and its **primary purpose** is to **serve as a backend tool for determining district assignments based on location data**.

Here’s a direct breakdown of its **application context** and **use cases**:

---

## 🧭 Application Purpose

### 🎯 **`benton_district_lookup` is a geospatial lookup backend**

It provides **programmatic access** to determine which administrative or electoral district a given address or coordinate belongs to.

---

## 🛠️ What Does It Do?

It’s an **internal utility or service** that:

| Functionality                      | Description                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📍 **District Mapping**            | Given an address, ZIP code, or lat/lon, return the district it belongs to |
| 🧭 **Jurisdiction Classification** | Determine fire zones, voting districts, or school boundaries              |
| 🗃️ **Local Database Access**      | Possibly query or load district maps stored locally (JSON, GeoJSON, etc.) |
| 📤 **CLI or API Service**          | Runs as either a command-line tool or a microservice backend              |
| 🔐 **Secure Internal Tool**        | Packaged and signed for internal distribution (via SharePoint or GPO)     |

## 🧩 Application Domains & Use Cases

| Department           | Usage Example                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IT/GIS**           | Lookup which police/fire district covers a given location |
| **Elections**        | Determine which voting precinct a user is in              |
| **Public Works**     | Assign service zones or snow plow routes                  |
| **School Systems**   | Find school district boundaries                           |
| **Customer Support** | Help desk verifies district coverage quickly              |

## 🧠 Why This Matters (ICSF Rationale)

This project is a **simulated real-world backend service** designed for:

* Practicing **secure deployment** workflows (code signing, release packaging)
* Understanding **lookup-based microservices** in critical infrastructure
* Learning how to build reliable Rust-based internal tools
* Integrating geospatial logic into scalable platforms

---

## 🛤️ How It Evolves

**Today:**
Runs as a binary that answers, for example:

```bash
benton_district_lookup --address "123 Main St, Benton County"
```

Output:

```
District: Zone 4
Jurisdiction: South Fire Department
Precinct: 12B
```

**Later:**
Becomes a backend microservice that powers:

* Public web portals
* GIS map overlays
* Frontend dashboards
* Emergency dispatch lookups

---

### ✅ Summary

You are building a **secure, optimized Rust tool** for **internal use**, which acts as a **district resolution engine** for future GIS, civic, or dispatch applications.

Would you like help adding:

* A sample CLI parsing implementation?
* A GeoJSON loader and spatial match function?
* A mock API server using Actix or Axum?

This is a solid foundation for something mission-critical. Let’s make it bulletproof.
