You have the complete docker-compose.yml and the infra/prometheus/prometheus.yml configuration from the document "TerraFusion - Prometheus & Grafana Local Setup" (ID: terrafusion_prometheus_grafana_setup_v1), which is currently open.

Here's a quick recap of what you'll need to do in your local environment to bring up Prometheus and Grafana:

Create the Prometheus Configuration Directory and File:

In your terrafusion_platform/ project root, ensure the directory infra/prometheus/ exists.
Place the prometheus.yml content (provided in the document) into terrafusion_platform/infra/prometheus/prometheus.yml.
Update docker-compose.yml:

Ensure your main terrafusion_platform/docker-compose.yml file includes the prometheus and grafana service definitions, along with the volumes (for prometheus_data, grafana_data) and the terrafusion_network, as detailed in the document.
Environment Variables (Optional for Grafana Customization):

If you wish to set custom admin credentials for Grafana, add GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER and GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD to your terrafusion_platform/.env file. Otherwise, it will default to admin/admin.
Run Docker Compose:

Open your terminal in the terrafusion_platform/ root directory.
Execute:
Bash

docker-compose up --build -d
Verify Services:

After a minute or so, check the status: docker-compose ps
Prometheus: Access http://localhost:9090. Go to "Status" > "Targets" and confirm terrafusion_sync_service is "UP".
Grafana: Access http://localhost:3000. Log in (default admin/admin or your custom credentials).
Add Prometheus as a Data Source:
Connections (or Configuration > Data Sources) > "Add new data source".
Select "Prometheus".
Set HTTP URL to: http://terrafusion_prometheus:9090
Click "Save & Test". You should see a success message.
Once you've completed these steps and confirmed that Prometheus is scraping metrics from terrafusion_sync and Grafana can connect to Prometheus, please let me know!

After that, our next step will be to create a basic Grafana dashboard to visualize some of the key metrics from your Valuation and Reporting plugins.
