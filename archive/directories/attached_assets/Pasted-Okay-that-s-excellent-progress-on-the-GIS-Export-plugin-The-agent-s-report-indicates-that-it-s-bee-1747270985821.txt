Okay, that's excellent progress on the GIS Export plugin! The agent's report indicates that it's been thoroughly tested in an isolated fashion, documentation has been updated, and critical fixes (like the datetime issue and ensuring the correct plugin implementation is used by the SyncService) have been made.

You've successfully:

Fixed issues in the GIS Export plugin.
Verified its API endpoints and job processing lifecycle.
Ensured its metrics are being collected.
Added a section for it to the Grafana dashboard and updated relevant documentation.
This means the GIS Export plugin is now at a similar stage of completion as the Valuation, Reporting, and Market Analysis plugins in terms of its core functionality, database interaction, and basic observability.

Following our "TerraFusion Platform: Operational Implementation Plan" (ID: terrafusion_implementation_plan_operational_v1), the next crucial steps to fully "finalize" the GIS Export plugin (Phase 1, Task 1) are:

Ensure End-to-End Integration Tests for GIS Export are Passing in CI:

You've created and verified test scripts (test_gis_export_end_to_end.py or similar).
Action: Commit these tests and any related plugin code changes. Verify that your GitHub Actions CI pipeline (.github/workflows/ci.yml) executes these tests and that the entire CI run is green. This confirms the plugin works correctly in a clean, automated environment with its database dependencies.
Verify/Finalize Grafana Dashboard for GIS Export Metrics:

Action: With the plugin running and tests potentially generating metric data, double-check your Grafana dashboard. Ensure the panels for GIS Export metrics (e.g., gis_export_jobs_submitted_total, gis_export_processing_duration_seconds) are correctly configured, displaying data, and providing meaningful insights.
Refine GIS Export Plugin Logic (Simulated to Placeholder Real Interactions):

Action: Enhance the _simulate_gis_export_processing (or _process_gis_export_job) function in terrafusion_sync/plugins/gis_export/router.py.
Add placeholder logic to simulate fetching some data based on county_id and layers (e.g., log a count of properties from PropertyOperational for the given county_id).
Simulate file creation more tangibly (e.g., log the intended filename and path) and update result_file_location in the GisExportJob database record. This makes the simulated output more concrete for testing and frontend development.
Once these three items are addressed for the GIS Export plugin, it will be fully "battle-ready" alongside the other core plugins.

After that, the very next major priority from our plan is Phase 1, Task 2: Implement Gateway Security - MVP.

Would you like to focus on ensuring the CI pipeline integration for the GIS Export tests is solid as the immediate next step?
