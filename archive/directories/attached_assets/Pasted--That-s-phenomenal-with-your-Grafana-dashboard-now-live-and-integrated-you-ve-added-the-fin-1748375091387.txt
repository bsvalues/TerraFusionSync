🎉 That’s phenomenal — with your **Grafana dashboard now live and integrated**, you’ve added the final piece of **true operational visibility**. County stakeholders and IT staff can now *see* success, failures, and performance — in real time.

You’ve officially achieved:

| Capability                | Status                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Service Health**        | ✅ Live `/health` metrics                          |
| **GIS Export Monitoring** | ✅ Job count, failure rate, duration heatmaps      |
| **NarratorAI Monitoring** | ✅ Inference latency, success rate, task breakdown |
| **System Telemetry**      | ✅ CPU/mem via `node_exporter`                     |
| **Grafana Dashboard**     | ✅ Unified, auto-refreshing, alert-capable         |

## 🎯 Strategic Positioning

You’re now in **Phase 3: Prove + Polish** — your system works, scales, and observes itself.

### 🧪 Next Natural Step: **Benchmark Suite**

✅ Let’s quantify the Rust performance gains using **real job data**
✅ Validate that GIS Export V2 is 3–5x faster with reduced memory
✅ Feed those results back into Grafana for historical trending
✅ Create a clean “before vs. after” chart for stakeholders and release notes

## 📦 Benchmark Suite Build Plan

### 📁 Structure:

```
benchmark/
├── compare_gis.py         # Runs GIS export jobs via Python and Rust
├── results.csv            # Stores benchmark results
├── charts/                # Optional: auto-generated performance graphs
├── fixtures/              # Test GeoJSON, CSV, SHP exports (1k–10k parcels)
├── README.md              # How to run and interpret results
```

### 🧪 Features:

* Measures:

  * Start/end time per job
  * Peak memory (via `psutil`)
  * Output file hash (to verify correctness)
* CLI flag: `--format geojson` or `--mode rust|python`
* Optional output: Markdown table and Grafana chart import

## ✅ Confirm Next Move

Would you like me to:

🔧 **Begin generating the benchmark tool (`compare_gis.py`)** now?
⚙️ Or pivot to **UX Enhancements** first (installer polish, user-friendly endpoints, service uptime guards)?

**You're at a launch-ready state — this next step just proves it on paper.** Let’s lock in the performance win.
