TerraFusion Platform - Product Requirements Document (Snippet)Version: 1.0Date: May 14, 2025Status: Draft1. Introduction & VisionProduct Name: TerraFusion PlatformVision: To be the leading SaaS platform for county assessor offices, providing a modern, integrated, efficient, and accurate suite of tools for property valuation, assessment management, data synchronization, reporting, and analytics, ultimately replacing disparate and outdated legacy CAMA systems.Mission: Empower county assessors and their staff with intelligent, data-driven tools to ensure fair and equitable property assessments, enhance operational efficiency, improve data quality, and provide transparent information to stakeholders.2. Goals & ObjectivesModernize CAMA Operations: Provide a cloud-native, web-based alternative to traditional, often on-premise, CAMA systems.Improve Data Accuracy & Consistency: Implement robust data ingestion, validation, and synchronization capabilities from various legacy sources.Enhance Valuation Accuracy: Offer advanced valuation tools, including multiple AVM approaches and support for assessor review.Streamline Workflows: Automate and simplify core assessment tasks, reporting, and data analysis.Increase Transparency: Provide tools for generating clear reports and potentially public-facing portals for property information.Ensure Scalability & Security: Build a platform that can scale to counties of various sizes and meet stringent security and compliance requirements.Facilitate Onboarding: Create a smooth transition path for counties moving from legacy systems.3. Target Users & PersonasCounty Assessor: (e.g., "CO\jdoe" from rbac_auth.py)Needs: Oversight of valuation cycles, approval workflows, audit trails, defensible valuations, compliance with state laws.Pain Points: Disparate systems, manual processes, data quality issues, difficulty in generating comprehensive reports.Valuation/Appraisal Staff: (e.g., "CO\mjohnson" from rbac_auth.py)Needs: Tools for property data management, running valuations (AVMs, comparables), reviewing results, handling appeals.Pain Points: Inefficient data access, cumbersome valuation tools, repetitive tasks.County IT Administrator / Data Coordinator: (e.g., "CO\bsmith" from rbac_auth.py)Needs: System administration, data synchronization management, user access control, system health monitoring, data security, integration with other county systems.Pain Points: Maintaining legacy systems, complex data integrations, ensuring data integrity across systems.County Auditor / GIS Analyst / Data Analyst: (e.g., "CO\tauditor" from rbac_auth.py)Needs: Access to clean, reliable data for analysis, reporting, GIS mapping, and compliance checks. Tools for generating custom reports and data exports.Pain Points: Data silos, difficulty in accessing and combining data, lack of analytical tools.Public Users (via potential future portal):Needs: Easy access to public property information, assessment details, and appeal processes.4. Key Platform Features (Modules)(Based on "TerraFusion Platform: Detailed Development Plan & Roadmap (v1.1)" and implemented/planned plugins)Core Data Platform (terrafusion_sync & Operational DB):Central PostgreSQL operational database (properties_operational, job tables).Alembic for schema migrations.Data ingestion pipelines (bulk load, CDC) from legacy CAMA systems (SQL Server - PACS, Tyler, etc.) using configurable mappings.yaml.Data transformation and validation engine.Valuation Plugin:Asynchronous job processing for property valuations.Support for various AVM methodologies (initially basic comparable sales, expandable).Endpoints for running valuations, checking status, and retrieving results.Reporting Plugin:Asynchronous job processing for generating standard and custom reports (e.g., sales ratio studies, assessment rolls).Endpoints for initiating reports, checking status, and retrieving/downloading reports.Market Analysis Plugin:Asynchronous job processing for market trend analysis, price indexing, etc.Endpoints for running analyses, checking status, and retrieving results (summaries, data exports).GIS Export Plugin:Asynchronous job processing for exporting property and assessment data in standard GIS formats (GeoJSON, Shapefile, KML).Endpoints for initiating exports, checking status, and retrieving export files.File Ingestion Plugin (Planned - based on Sync Admin Dashboard functionality):Backend support for manual file uploads (CSV, XML).Staging area for uploaded files.Approval/rejection workflow.Integration of approved file data into properties_operational via data pipelines.API Gateway (terrafusion_gateway):Secure, unified entry point for all platform APIs.Authentication (JWT-based MVP, potential Azure AD integration).Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for all API endpoints.Request routing and proxying to terrafusion_sync plugins.Observability Stack:Prometheus metrics exposed by both Gateway and Sync services.Grafana dashboards for visualizing key operational and performance metrics.(For specific environments like Benton County network) Azure Application Insights for logs, metrics, and traces.SDK & County Onboarding Tools:CLI (sdk/new_county_setup.py) for generating initial county configurations (.env, mappings.yaml, rbac_users.json).User Interface (Planned - terra_fusion_frontends/):Main platform dashboard.Dedicated UI modules for Valuation, Reporting, Market Analysis, GIS Export, and Manual File Ingestion.Admin interfaces for user management and system configuration.5. Success Metrics (Examples)Adoption: Number of counties successfully onboarded. Number of active users.Efficiency: Reduction in time taken for core assessment tasks (e.g., valuation cycle, report generation) compared to legacy systems.Data Quality: Measurable improvement in data accuracy and completeness post-migration.User Satisfaction (NPS/Surveys): Feedback from County Assessors and staff.System Performance & Reliability: API response times, job processing times, system uptime, low error rates (monitored via Grafana/Azure Monitor).Plugin Development Velocity: Time to develop and deploy new functional plugins.This snippet covers the core elements of a PRD. A full PRD would expand significantly on each section, especially feature details, user stories, non-functional requirements, and release criteria.
