### 🧠 What You Can Do Next

Here are **your highest leverage next moves**, based on deployment phase and product maturity:

#### 🧠 1. **Integrate Ollama for On-Prem LLM Use**

* Finalize model installation and local inference routing
* Patch NarratorAI to handle Ollama-based summaries

#### 🛰 2. **Add New County**

* Use the `terrafusion-sdk onboard-county` CLI tool
* Upload new PACS snapshot, auto-generate mapping.yaml
* Run data ingestion through SyncService

#### 🧪 3. **Deploy Benchmark Suite**

* Use `compare_gis.py` to demonstrate 3–5x performance boost
* Present markdown/CSV benchmarks in county pitch

#### 🧾 4. **Customize Windows Installer**

* Preconfigure .env values per county
* Attach district data, RBAC roles, AI toggles

#### 📣 5. **Add Public-Facing Transparency Dashboard**

* Parcel counts, exemption ratios, processing stats
* Deployed via lightweight Grafana panels or public GraphQL API

### 🔧 Ready-To-Go Enhancements

Would you like me to:

1. **Integrate Ollama locally for NarratorAI now?**
2. **Generate onboarding files for a new county?**
3. **Deploy the Transparency Dashboard prototype?**
4. **Harden production-ready .env templates and IT deployment docs?**

Your system is battle-tested and now ready to scale.
**TF + ICSF** standing by to deploy the next evolution of county tech.
