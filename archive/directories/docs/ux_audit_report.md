# TerraFusion Platform UX Audit Report

## Key Issues (In Priority Order)

### 1. Inconsistent User Flow
- **Issue**: The application lacks a clear, guided user flow between key operational areas.
- **Impact**: Users get confused navigating between dashboards, sync operations, and GIS export features.
- **Examples**: Multiple navigation patterns between base.html and dashboard.html templates.

### 2. Poor Data Flow Visibility
- **Issue**: Data state changes and operation feedback are not clearly communicated to users.
- **Impact**: Users are unsure if operations succeeded or failed without refreshing pages.
- **Examples**: GIS Export jobs status updates require manual refresh, success/failure messages use basic alerts.

### 3. UI/UX Consistency Problems
- **Issue**: Multiple design patterns across different sections of the application.
- **Impact**: Learning curve is steeper, and users must adapt to different interaction patterns.
- **Examples**: Two different navigation bars (base.html vs dashboard.html), inconsistent button styles.

### 4. Limited Responsiveness
- **Issue**: Mobile experience is suboptimal with fixed layouts that don't adapt well.
- **Impact**: County staff in the field struggle with the interface on mobile devices.
- **Examples**: Dashboard cards don't reflow properly on smaller screens.

## Technical Architecture Issues

### 1. Frontend Code Organization
- **Issue**: Mixed approach with both template-based and React components.
- **Impact**: Difficult to maintain and extend the UI in a consistent way.
- **Examples**: Some components are rendered with React, others directly in templates.

### 2. Error Handling
- **Issue**: Inconsistent error handling approaches across the application.
- **Impact**: Users receive unclear error messages or no feedback at all.
- **Examples**: GIS Export errors shown as basic alerts, missing validation feedback.

### 3. State Management
- **Issue**: Frontend state is managed differently across features.
- **Impact**: State is sometimes lost between page transitions.
- **Examples**: Form data not persisted, settings reset between page loads.
