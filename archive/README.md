# TerraFusion Archive

This directory contains code that was removed during codebase cleanup but preserved for reference.

## Archived Components

### Application Variants
- `app_azure.py` - Azure-specific Flask implementation
- `app_simple.py` - Minimal demonstration version
- `backup_scheduler.py` - Automated backup system
- `backup_utilities.py` - Database backup utilities
- `api_extensions.py` - Public API extensions

### Reason for Archival
These components contained overlapping functionality, technical debt, or were not actively used in the core platform.

### Restoration
If any archived functionality is needed, it can be selectively restored and integrated into the clean codebase.
