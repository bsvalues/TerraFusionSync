# TerraFusion Platform - Rust Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for migrating the TerraFusion Platform from Python to Rust, focusing on a phased approach to minimize disruption while maximizing performance gains.

## Migration Goals

1. **Performance Improvement**: Utilize Rust's superior performance for compute-intensive operations
2. **Improved Reliability**: Leverage Rust's strong type system and memory safety guarantees
3. **Better Concurrency**: Take advantage of Rust's zero-cost abstractions for parallel execution
4. **Maintainability**: Establish a clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
5. **Seamless Transition**: Minimize downtime and disruption to existing users

## Architecture

The new Rust-based architecture consists of three primary microservices:

1. **API Gateway**: Entry point for client requests, handling authentication, request routing, and UI rendering
2. **Sync Service**: Core synchronization engine for data exchange between systems
3. **GIS Export Service**: Specialized service for geospatial data processing and exports

These services share a common library for database access, error handling, telemetry, and shared models.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup & Common Library (Completed)

- [x] Create Cargo workspace structure
- [x] Implement core error types and utilities
- [x] Set up database connection management
- [x] Build telemetry and metrics framework
- [x] Create shared models for sync operations and GIS exports
- [x] Establish migration scripts for database schema

## Phase 2: Service Implementation (In Progress)

- [x] Implement API Gateway service
- [x] Implement Sync Service engine
- [x] Implement GIS Export service
- [x] Create service health checks and metrics endpoints
- [ ] Implement comprehensive tests for each service
- [ ] Perform load testing and optimization

## Phase 3: Integration & Deployment (Upcoming)

- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for Rust services
- [ ] Create Docker containers for each service
- [ ] Implement blue-green deployment strategy
- [ ] Integrate with existing authentication systems
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerting

## Phase 4: Gradual Transition (Upcoming)

- [ ] Run Rust services alongside existing Python services
- [ ] Gradually shift traffic from Python to Rust implementations
- [ ] Monitor performance and errors carefully during transition
- [ ] Validate data consistency between implementations
- [ ] Complete switchover once stability is confirmed

## Phase 5: Legacy System Retirement (Upcoming)

- [ ] Decommission Python services
- [ ] Archive legacy codebase
- [ ] Document completed migration
- [ ] Conduct performance comparison
- [ ] Share lessons learned

## Technical Details

### Database Migration

Database schema migration uses Diesel's migration framework with versioned SQL scripts located in `terrarust/migrations/`. Migration can be applied using the `migration_runner.rs` tool.

### Service Deployment

Deployment uses the `deploy.sh` script which:
1. Builds all Rust components
2. Copies binaries and configuration to appropriate directories
3. Runs database migrations if specified
4. Starts services in the correct order

### Environment Configuration

Configuration is stored in TOML files at `terrarust/config/` with environment-specific overrides. Runtime configuration can be supplied via environment variables.

### Monitoring

The new Rust services expose Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoints and structured logging suitable for ingestion into Elasticsearch or similar systems.

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Completed
- **Phase 2**: Current - Expected completion in 2 weeks
- **Phase 3**: Expected start in 3 weeks, completion in 5 weeks
- **Phase 4**: Expected start in 6 weeks, completion in 9 weeks
- **Phase 5**: Expected start in 10 weeks, completion in 12 weeks

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Performance degradation | Low | High | Thorough benchmarking, staged rollout |
| Data inconsistency | Medium | High | Dual-write period with validation |
| Service disruption | Medium | High | Blue-green deployment strategy |
| Learning curve | High | Medium | Training, documentation, code reviews |
| Unknown edge cases | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive testing, monitoring |

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during the migration:

1. Immediately revert traffic to Python services
2. Diagnose issues in isolated environment
3. Fix and retest Rust services
4. Retry migration with additional monitoring

## Success Criteria

1. All functionality available in Rust implementation
2. Performance improvements of at least 30% for key operations
3. No increase in error rates compared to Python implementation
4. Decreased resource usage (CPU, memory)
5. Improved maintainability as measured by code quality metrics
