# TerraFusion Platform: Python to Rust Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for migrating the TerraFusion Platform from Python to Rust. The migration aims to improve performance, security, and reliability while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Migration Goals

- **Performance Improvement**: Leverage Rust's efficiency for faster data processing and reduced resource usage
- **Enhanced Security**: Utilize Rust's memory safety guarantees and ownership model
- **Improved Concurrency**: Take advantage of Rust's robust concurrency model
- **Maintainability**: Implement a cleaner architecture with better separation of concerns
- **Zero Downtime**: Ensure uninterrupted service during the migration

## Migration Strategy

We will use a phased approach with side-by-side operation of Python and Rust components during the transition:

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup and Common Library (Current)

- ✅ Set up Rust project structure with workspace for all components
- ✅ Create common library for shared functionality
- ✅ Implement error handling and database connectivity
- ✅ Define core data models and utilities
- ✅ Establish API contracts and interface definitions

### Phase 2: API Gateway Implementation

- ✅ Implement web interface with templates
- ✅ Build authentication and authorization middleware
- ✅ Create routing and request handling
- ⬜ Integrate with existing services during transition
- ⬜ Implement comprehensive test suite
- ⬜ Deploy alongside existing gateway with traffic splitting

### Phase 3: SyncService Migration

- ⬜ Implement core sync engine
- ⬜ Build database models and migrations
- ⬜ Create API endpoints for sync operations
- ⬜ Add conflict resolution mechanisms
- ⬜ Develop audit logging and metrics
- ⬜ Test against production workloads
- ⬜ Gradually shift traffic from Python to Rust service

### Phase 4: GIS Export Service Migration

- ⬜ Implement geospatial data processing
- ⬜ Build export generation for all formats
- ⬜ Create API endpoints for export operations
- ⬜ Add county-specific configuration handling
- ⬜ Incorporate visualization features
- ⬜ Test with sample datasets
- ⬜ Deploy and gradually replace Python service

### Phase 5: Validation and Full Transition

- ⬜ Conduct comprehensive testing across all components
- ⬜ Perform security audit of new implementation
- ⬜ Validate performance metrics against goals
- ⬜ Complete documentation updates
- ⬜ Finalize monitoring and observability
- ⬜ Fully decommission Python services

## Architecture

The new architecture will be composed of:

1. **Common Library (`terrarust/common`)**
   - Shared models, utilities, and database connectivity
   - Error handling and telemetry
   - Geo processing utilities

2. **API Gateway (`terrarust/api_gateway`)**
   - Handles authentication and authorization
   - Routes requests to appropriate services
   - Serves web UI using Handlebars templates
   - Provides unified API endpoints

3. **Sync Service (`terrarust/sync_service`)**
   - Core data synchronization engine
   - Conflict detection and resolution
   - Scheduling and management of sync operations
   - Historical data and audit trail

4. **GIS Export Service (`terrarust/gis_export`)**
   - Geospatial data processing
   - Format conversion and export generation
   - County-specific configuration handling
   - Export job management

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Rust (2021 edition)
- **Web Framework**: Actix Web
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLx for async operations
- **ORM**: Diesel for type-safe SQL
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with middleware
- **Templating**: Handlebars
- **Geospatial**: GDAL/OGR bindings via gdal and geo crates
- **Containerization**: Docker for deployment
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all components with high coverage targets
- Integration tests for service interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Performance benchmarks against Python implementation
- Load testing to validate scalability

## Migration Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Functionality gaps | Comprehensive feature matrix verification and test coverage |
| Performance regressions | Benchmark critical paths and performance testing |
| Extended migration timeline | Phased approach with functioning milestones |
| Knowledge transfer challenges | Documentation and code reviews, pair programming |
| Data migration issues | Side-by-side operation with validation before full cutover |

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 2 weeks (Complete)
- **Phase 2**: 3 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 4 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 3 weeks
- **Phase 5**: 2 weeks

Total estimated time: 14 weeks

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: 3x improvement in throughput for sync operations
- **Resource Usage**: 50% reduction in CPU and memory usage
- **Error Rates**: Reduction in error rates by at least 30%
- **Code Quality**: Higher test coverage (target: 80%+)
- **Maintenance**: Reduced time to implement new features

## Conclusion

This migration represents a significant investment in the future of the TerraFusion Platform. By transitioning to Rust, we aim to create a more robust, efficient, and maintainable system that will better serve county assessor offices and their geospatial data needs.

Progress will be tracked through regular updates to this document and the project management system.
